# Thursday Week 5

Setting up the vitual environments went decently.  But I have no previous knowledge of Python so I had a hard time understanding a lot of the Tutorial.  This has also made the assignment seem rather intimidating since I have never coded in python before.  The testing element of the tutorial is interesting though and I was able to understand that.  It was only the python portion that held me back.
